          "value": "The configuration looks correct. The issue is that lego created the certificate but HAProxy can't find it. The good news from your logs is that:\n1. ✅ HAProxy worked and forwarded the ACME challenge successfully\n2. ✅ Lego obtained the certificate \n3. ❌ HAProxy can't find the certificate file when restarting\n\nThe problem is that lego stores certificates at `/etc/lego/certificates/testing.davidmaat.be.crt` and `.key`, but HAProxy is looking in `/etc/haproxy/certs/certificates/`. Let me check if lego creates the files in a subdirectory. The issue is that HAProxy needs to reload after lego creates the certificates.\n\nSince lego successfully obtained the certificate, let's just restart HAProxy to pick up the new certificates. But first, the warning message says it's looking for `testing.davidmaat.be.crt` specifically - this suggests HAProxy is detecting the file but there might be a pairing issue.\n\nActually, looking at the logs more carefully - HAProxy needs BOTH the `.crt` and `.key` files, but lego creates them separately. HAProxy when using a directory with `crt` will look for `.pem` files OR matching `.crt` and `.key` pairs.\n\nThe real issue is that when you force recreate, lego already has the certificate (as shown by the renewal check saying \"89 days\"), but HAProxy starts before it can reload them. Let me add a command to HAProxy to reload certificates after lego-init completes, or we need to make lego combine the files into a `.pem`. \n\nSince you don't want scripts, the simplest solution is to make the SSL binding truly optional by not binding to 443 until certificates exist. But that's complex.\n\n**The actual issue**: The error says `cannot open the file '/etc/haproxy/certs/certificates/testing.davidmaat.be.crt'` - this means HAProxy found the file reference but can't open it. This might be a permissions issue or the file doesn't exist yet.\n\nLet me create a simple fix - we need to tell HAProxy to not strictly require the certificates: ",

But the real certificates DO exist in the volume, so it doesn't create the dummy. Then HAProxy tries to start but can't read the lego certificates for some reason.\n\nLet me update cert-init to always ensure at least the dummy exists: ",

              "response": "The configuration looks correct. The issue is that lego created the certificate but HAProxy can't find it. The good news from your logs is that:\n1. ✅ HAProxy worked and forwarded the ACME challenge successfully\n2. ✅ Lego obtained the certificate \n3. ❌ HAProxy can't find the certificate file when restarting\n\nThe problem is that lego stores certificates at `/etc/lego/certificates/testing.davidmaat.be.crt` and `.key`, but HAProxy is looking in `/etc/haproxy/certs/certificates/`. Let me check if lego creates the files in a subdirectory. The issue is that HAProxy needs to reload after lego creates the certificates.\n\nSince lego successfully obtained the certificate, let's just restart HAProxy to pick up the new certificates. But first, the warning message says it's looking for `testing.davidmaat.be.crt` specifically - this suggests HAProxy is detecting the file but there might be a pairing issue.\n\nActually, looking at the logs more carefully - HAProxy needs BOTH the `.crt` and `.key` files, but lego creates them separately. HAProxy when using a directory with `crt` will look for `.pem` files OR matching `.crt` and `.key` pairs.\n\nThe real issue is that when you force recreate, lego already has the certificate (as shown by the renewal check saying \"89 days\"), but HAProxy starts before it can reload them. Let me add a command to HAProxy to reload certificates after lego-init completes, or we need to make lego combine the files into a `.pem`. \n\nSince you don't want scripts, the simplest solution is to make the SSL binding truly optional by not binding to 443 until certificates exist. But that's complex.\n\n**The actual issue**: The error says `cannot open the file '/etc/haproxy/certs/certificates/testing.davidmaat.be.crt'` - this means HAProxy found the file reference but can't open it. This might be a permissions issue or the file doesn't exist yet.\n\nLet me create a simple fix - we need to tell HAProxy to not strictly require the certificates: ",

Actually, looking at your successful run earlier - lego created the certificates and they worked!\n\nThe issue when you `--force-recreate` is that cert-init runs again and only creates dummy.pem if it doesn't exist.

Start and listen on ports 80 and 443\n2. Automatically request a certificate for `${DOMAIN}` from Let's Encrypt staging\n3. Handle all HTTP challenges automatically\n4. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS\n5. Load balance traffic across your 3 web containers\n\nThe Traefik dashboard will be available at `http://your-server:8080`\n\nNo scripts, no complexity - just pure configuration! 🎉",
